A group of real estate investors are looking to put a bid on a group of 10 homes that have come up for sale. 
They want a 20% margin so they can make a profit when they resell the homes. 
Predict the price for the homes up for bid and factor in the margin to give the investors a final bid amount to make for these houses.

One of the sheets in the excel workbook contains the past home sales (Past Sales Data). 
The past home sales data was used to build a linear regression model, which produced a formula to help predict a home's value based on:
- the number of bedrooms
- bathrooms
- the square footage of the home. 

The formula obtained:

price = 51880.41 + 44.72 * square feet + 52613.9 * bedrooms + 27513.48 * bathrooms

This formula is then applied to the homes up for bid.

Lastly, Data Combined for Graph shows how to graph bedroom vs. price for both the past home sales and predicted prices of the homes up for bid.
